It's my first (real and) big CakePHP project in combination with Git. I've worked over 3 years to release
a game like this but had many fall backs and fresh starts. In end 2010 I decided to make it Opensource
because I needed more time for my own business and have many other side projects where I'm working on.
Some of the content maybe from other people/companies. Please take a look at my special thank page for
the credits <http://www.naxasius.com/pages/view/4>.

Any comment is welcome. See the install file for more information and check the Wiki to help you through
the code.

* Converstaions (in Fallout 3 style for gaining or losing Karma and other Stats);
* Character customization (equiping Weapons and Items, Talents Tree and Stats);

* And much more!

## Troubleshooting ##

Game engine is running on Cake 1.3 and has known issues with PHP 5 and above. Use the Cakephp2.x branch when you use a higher PHP version. Please note that this branch is not stable.

*TODO*

* Replacing the localization function from __('var', true) to __('var') and __('var', true) to echo __('var')
